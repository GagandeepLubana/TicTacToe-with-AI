# TicTacToe-with-AI

**Description**

A graphical Tic Tac Toe game with two modes. The player will be able to select who to play against, either another player, or the AI. The AI boasts logical moves and random moves which makes it very hard to beat while keeping the algorithm's complexity to the minimum. This program uses the pygame library to display the game's functions in a GUI rather than the command-line or the web.
